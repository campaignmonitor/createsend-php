* Updated constant definitions so PHP Notices aren't raised

## v4.0.1 - 30 May, 2014

* Updated the class_exists check to no longer call __autoload

## v4.0.0 - 6 Feb, 2014

* Updated to v3.1 API
* Added support for new segments structure
  * Segment now includes a new `RuleGroups` member, instead of a `Rules` member.

	    So for example, when you _previously_ would have created a segment like so:

	    ```php
		$result = $wrap->create('Segments List ID', array(
			'Title' => 'Segment Title',
			'Rules' => array(
				array(
					'Subject' => 'EmailAddress',
					'Clauses' => array(
						'CONTAINS example.com'
					)
				) ,
				array(
					'Subject' => '[customfield]',
					'Clauses' => array(
						'PROVIDED',
						'EQUALS 1'
					)
				)
			)
		));
	    ```

	    You would _now_ do this:

	    ```php
		$result = $wrap->create('Segments List ID', array(
			'Title' => 'Segment Title',
			'RuleGroups' => array(
				array(
					'Rules' => array(
						array(
							'RuleType' => 'EmailAddress',
							'Clause' => 'CONTAINS example.com'
						)
					)
				) ,
				array(
					'Rules' => array(
						array(
							'RuleType' => '[customfield]',
							'Clause' => 'PROVIDED'
						) ,
						array(
							'RuleType' => '[customfield]',
							'Clause' => 'EQUALS 1'
						)
					)
				)
			)
		));
    ```

  * The Add Rule call is now Add Rule Group, taking a `ruleGroup` argument instead of a `rule` argument.

    ```php
    function CS_REST_Segments->add_rulegroup($rulegroup)
    ```

    So for example, when you _previously_ would have added a rule like so:

    ```php
    $wrap = new CS_REST_Segments('Segment ID', $auth);
	$result = $wrap->add_rule(array(
	    'Subject' => 'EmailAddress',
	    'Clauses' => array('CONTAINS example.com')
	));
    ```

    You would _now_ do this:

    ```php
	$wrap = new CS_REST_Segments('Segment ID', $auth);
	$result = $wrap->add_rulegroup(array(
	    'Rules' => array(
	        array(
	            'RuleType' => 'EmailAddress',
	            'Clause' => 'CONTAINS example.com'
	        )
	    )
	));
    ```
* Removed the get_apikey method to promote usage of oAuth authentication

## v3.1.3 - 10 Dec, 2013

* Fixed a notice that was raised when unscheduling a campaign.

## v3.1.2 - 28 Oct, 2013

## v3.1.1 - 3 Oct, 2013

## v3.1.0 - 15 Apr, 2013

* Added support for [single sign on](http://www.campaignmonitor.com/api/account/#single_sign_on) which allows initiation of external login sessions to Campaign Monitor.

## v3.0.0 - 25 Mar, 2013

* Added support for authenticating using OAuth. See the [README](README.md#authenticating) for full usage instructions.
  * This introduces some changes to how you authenticate using this library. You now authenticate by passing an `$auth` array as the first argument when creating instances of any classes which inherit from the `CS_REST_Wrapper_Base` class.

      So in existing code, when you _previously_ would have authenticated using an API key as follows:

      ```php
      $wrap = new CS_REST_General('Your API Key');
      $result = $wrap->get_clients();
      ```

      If you want to authenticate using an API key, you should _now_ do this:

      ```php
      $wrap = new CS_REST_General(array('api_key' => 'Your API Key'));
      $result = $wrap->get_clients();
      ```
